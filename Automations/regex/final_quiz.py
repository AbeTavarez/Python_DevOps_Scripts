# * Question 1
# We're working with a CSV file, which contains employee information. Each record has a name field, followed by a phone number field, and a role field. The phone number field contains U.S. phone numbers, and needs to be modified to the international format, with "+1-" in front of the phone number. Fill in the regular expression, using groups, to use the transform_record function to do that.


def transform_record(record):
    new_record = re.sub(r'([\d-]+)', r'+1-\1', record)
    return new_record


print(transform_record("Sabrina Green,802-867-5309,System Administrator"))
# Sabrina Green,+1-802-867-5309,System Administrator

print(transform_record("Eli Jones,684-3481127,IT specialist"))
# Eli Jones,+1-684-3481127,IT specialist

print(transform_record("Melody Daniels,846-687-7436,Programmer"))
# Melody Daniels,+1-846-687-7436,Programmer

print(transform_record("Charlie Rivera,698-746-3357,Web Developer"))
# Charlie Rivera,+1-698-746-3357,Web Developer


# * Question 2
# The multi_vowel_words function returns all words with 3 or more consecutive vowels (a, e, i, o, u). Fill in the regular expression to do that.

def multi_vowel_words(text):
    pattern = r'\b(?=[a-z]*[aeiou]{3,})[a-z]+\b'
    result = re.findall(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE)
    return result


print(multi_vowel_words("Life is beautiful"))
# ['beautiful']

print(multi_vowel_words("Obviously, the queen is courageous and gracious."))
# ['Obviously', 'queen', 'courageous', 'gracious']

print(multi_vowel_words(
    "The rambunctious children had to sit quietly and await their delicious dinner."))
# ['rambunctious', 'quietly', 'delicious']

print(multi_vowel_words("The order of a data queue is First In First Out (FIFO)"))
# ['queue']

print(multi_vowel_words("Hello world!"))
# []


# *Question 4
# The transform_comments function converts comments in a Python script into those usable by a C compiler. This means looking for text that begins with a hash mark (#) and replacing it with double slashes (//), which is the C single-line comment indicator. For the purpose of this exercise, we'll ignore the possibility of a hash mark embedded inside of a Python command, and assume that it's only used to indicate a comment. We also want to treat repetitive hash marks (##), (###), etc., as a single comment indicator, to be replaced with just (//) and not (#//) or (//#). Fill in the parameters of the substitution method to complete this function:

def transform_comments(line_of_code):
    result = re.sub(r'([\#])+', r'//', line_of_code)
    return result


print(transform_comments("### Start of program"))
# Should be "// Start of program"
print(transform_comments("  number = 0   ## Initialize the variable"))
# Should be "  number = 0   // Initialize the variable"
print(transform_comments("  number += 1   # Increment the variable"))
# Should be "  number += 1   // Increment the variable"
print(transform_comments("  return(number)"))
# Should be "  return(number)"
