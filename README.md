# Python for OS

## Intro

### Create a script

- Create a python file `vim script_0.py` type `#!/usr/bin/env python3` on the first line.

Note: Inserting a shebang line (such as #!/usr/bin/env python3) as the first line tells the operating system what command we want to use to execute the script.

- On the next line type `print("Running script...")`.
- On your terminal type `chmod +x script_0.py` to change the file permission.
- Run the script from the terminal `./script_0.py`
